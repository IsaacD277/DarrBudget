# Last Update

What I worked on last so I don't have to remember by looking through the code.

- Changed the homescreen to now be the bucket list view
- Now has a plus button on home screen to add a bucket
- Put in a custom Year/month picker which I'll probably change at some point but it works for now
- Added an info screen to test the custom number typer and find the database files

### September 28, 2024

- Updated the folder structure to organize the project a little more
- PaymentModel is no longer being used, just to simplify the first version. At some point I will need to add it in again.
- Working on using built-in dates instead of the custom built month enum I originally setup. Need to figure out how to use the month as an Int but still display all the months as strings.
- Implemented the custom keyboard
- Starting git repo to keep a better history.
