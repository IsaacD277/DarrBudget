- I updated the folder structure to organize the project a little more
- PaymentModel is no longer being used, just to simplify the first version. At some point I will need to add it in again.
- Working on using built-in dates instead of the custom built month enum I originally setup. Need to figure out how to use the month as an Int but still display all the months as strings.
- Implemented the custom keyboard
- Starting git repo to keep a better history.
